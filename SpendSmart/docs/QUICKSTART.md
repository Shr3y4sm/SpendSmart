## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Port Already in Use?
If port 5000 is busy, edit `run.py` and change:
```python
app.run(debug=True, host='0.0.0.0', port=5001)  # Changed to 5001
```

### Virtual Environment Issues?
If you can't activate the venv, try:
```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```

### Missing Dependencies?
Make sure you installed Flask:
```powershell
pip install Flask==3.0.0
```
