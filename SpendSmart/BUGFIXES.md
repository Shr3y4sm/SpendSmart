# Bug Fixes - January 2025

## Issue: Budget Setting Not Working

### Root Cause
The `initBudgetManagement()` function in `budget.js` was defined but never called during page initialization. This meant:
- Budget form submission handler was never attached
- Budget status was never loaded on page load

### Fix Applied
Added call to `initBudgetManagement()` in the DOMContentLoaded event handler in `app.js`:

```javascript
// Initialize budget management
if (typeof initBudgetManagement === 'function') {
    initBudgetManagement();
}
```

### Files Modified
- `app/static/js/app.js` - Added initialization call

### Testing Steps
1. Log in to the application
2. Navigate to dashboard
3. Scroll to Budget Management section
4. Enter a budget amount (e.g., 10000)
5. Set alert threshold (e.g., 80%)
6. Click "Set Budget" button
7. Verify success message appears
8. Verify budget status displays correctly
9. Add some expenses
10. Verify budget progress updates

## Issue: Pages Not Loading (404 Errors)

### Investigation
Reviewed all routes in `routes.py` and verified they match the URLs being called by JavaScript:

#### Available Routes:
- `/` - Home (redirects to /dashboard if logged in)
- `/dashboard` - Dashboard (requires login)
- `/register` - Registration page
- `/login` - Login page
- `/logout` - Logout
- `/profile` - User profile (requires login)
- `/api/expenses` - GET, POST
- `/api/expenses/<id>` - GET, PUT, DELETE
- `/api/budget` - GET, POST
- `/api/budget/status` - GET
- `/api/categorize` - POST
- `/api/categorize/suggestions` - POST
- `/api/insights` - GET
- `/api/insights/trends` - GET
- `/api/visualization/data` - GET
- `/api/stats` - GET
- `/api/health` - GET

### Potential Causes
1. **Trailing Slash Issues**: Flask treats `/dashboard` and `/dashboard/` as different routes
2. **Authentication Redirects**: Unauthenticated API requests may redirect to login
3. **Production vs Development**: Render may handle static files differently
4. **Browser Cache**: Old JavaScript may be cached

### Recommendations
1. Clear browser cache and hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)
2. Check browser console for specific 404 URLs
3. Verify authentication status before API calls
4. Add error logging to identify specific failing routes

## Production Deployment Notes

### Known Limitations
- **SQLite Database**: Resets when Render service restarts (every ~15 minutes of inactivity on free tier)
- **Static Files**: Should be served correctly via Flask's static folder
- **Environment Variables**: Must be set in Render dashboard

### Monitoring
Check Render logs for:
- 404 errors with specific URL paths
- 500 errors with stack traces
- Authentication failures
- Database connection issues

### Testing URLs
Test these URLs directly in browser (replace with your Render URL):
- `https://spendsmart-0sa0.onrender.com/`
- `https://spendsmart-0sa0.onrender.com/dashboard`
- `https://spendsmart-0sa0.onrender.com/api/health`
- `https://spendsmart-0sa0.onrender.com/login`

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy the fix**: Push changes to GitHub to trigger Render rebuild
2. **Clear browser cache**: Ensure new JavaScript is loaded
3. **Test budget functionality**: Follow testing steps above
4. **Monitor for 404s**: Check browser console and Render logs
5. **Report specific URLs**: If 404s persist, identify exact failing URLs

## Debug Mode

To enable more detailed error logging, you can temporarily set in Render environment variables:
```
FLASK_ENV=development
```

**WARNING**: Do not leave debug mode enabled in production for security reasons.
